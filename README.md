# Figma Desktop for Mac OS
macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) or higher

This project is an unofficial desktop wrapper for Figma Web, created with Electron and intended solely for personal use. It is not affiliated with or supported by Figma. The goal of this build is non-commercial: to offer a simple way to access Figma on legacy macOS systems that no longer support the official desktop client.
The application is essentially a WebView container, embedding the Figma web platform inside an Electron shell. No modifications are made to Figma’s services or features — it provides the same experience available through the browser, packaged as a standalone app for convenience.

###For this build environment:

Chromium engine: 108.0.5359.215
Electron version: 22.3.27
Node.js version: 16.17.1
Operating system: macOS Mojave 10.14.6

Hardware: MacBook Pro Early 2011

The purpose is to extend usability for older Macs that cannot run newer apps but can still handle modern web technologies. By encapsulating Figma Web in Electron, users on outdated systems gain quicker, app-like access without depending on browser tabs.

In short, this build is a personal workaround to keep creative workflows alive on vintage hardware, ensuring that older macOS devices remain productive even as official software support ends.
